## Overview of Project
This project involved created a simple way for analysts to determine stock performance for 12 different stocks using excel files.  The excel macro is dynamic and can function year over year with no change.


## Results
Results of the analysis show that 2017 was a year of strong perfromance for a majority of stocks with returns falling in 2018.  2018 most likley represtns a pull back from above average returns.  This could have been cause by a larger macroeconomic event or seasonality in the business cycle. 


## Summary
Refactoring code has the advanage of improving simplifying and edit previous code, but also improving processing speed.  a disadvantage of refactoring code is that it takes time and may not be a critical value add for the business.  I can see teams moving quickly on projects and not having the time to go back and improve code if it is getting the job done. 

For the code in this excecise, processing time was reduced from approx. 4 seconds down to less than approx. 0.05 seconds.  So refacortring did provide the advantage of reducing processing speed.  I dont see a disadvantage for refactoring this code in the way we did.  I will say though there may be a few ways to improve the excel workbook so that is it more dynamic, such as handeling more than just these pre-set stocks.
